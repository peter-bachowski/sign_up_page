# sign_up_page

The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to create a sign up page using proper form validation techniques as well as creating a submit button that can post the information entered correctly. 

This project should also further show my css abilities to line up divs and different parts of the page smoothly and not have overlaps and/or unecessary overflow.

Thank you for taking the time to read my README.md!
